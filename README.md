## Welcome
Thanks for checking out my my first ever, full MEAN Stack web application!
This was built after 7 weeks of coding experience, half way through my full-time
immersive Web Development course at DevMountain in Provo, Utah.

#Purpose
I built this app so I would be able to not only log my expenses on a road-trip or
vacation, but so I could also sort through them and see where my money was spent.
I also figured I would want to save those past vacations just in case I needed to
reference certain places I went and amounts of money that I spent!

#Future updates
I have many things I still want to add and eventually will to make this page more fun.
-Budget page with built in graphs to show how much I've spent per day, how much I left to spend per day,
and other fun things to help stay in a set budget that will be input at the time of creating a new trip!
-Log in capabilities. I still haven't had a chance to add login capabilities via passport with local authentication,
as well as Facebook or Twitter authentication.

#Thanks
